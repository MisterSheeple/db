update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This patch introduces anaglyph mode, render time emulation,
  and numerous bugfixes.<br>

  Render time emulation means that some in-game sequences run at the same speed they
  did on a real Virtual Boy, which no previous emulator has emulated accurately. This
  includes the Jack Bros. level transitions being as choppy as they originally were,
  so a toggle has been added to revert to the old behaviour. For more information,
  check out <a href="https://skyfloogle.github.io/vip-timing" rel="nofollow">my write-up</a>.</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added anaglyph mode, with configurable colours for each eye

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>2DS users can configure a depth offset in anaglyph mode, as they have no depth
  slider</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Add render time emulation, including a toggle to turn it off</li>

  <li>Fix audio bug in Colony intro in Galactic Pinball</li>

  <li>Fix various issues in the Game Boy emulator</li>

  <li>Fix Red Alarm wireframe graphics drawing on top of UI</li>

  <li>Add a hack for Jack Bros. to make the intro chime play at roughly the correct
  speed</li>

  <li>Apply game fixes based on game ID rather than checksum, for better compatibility
  with ROM hacks</li>

  <li>Increased frameskip aggressiveness to improve performance in Elevated Speed</li>

  <li>Update software framebuffer more conservatively to improve performance in Waterworld
  and 3-D Tetris</li>

  <li>Adjusted gamma correction for improved visibility</li>

  <li>Fix D-Pad ABXY mirroring having an incorrect right input</li>

  </ul>'
